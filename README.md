# zendesk-export-python
Exporting data out of Zendesk for further processing

Problem: 
- some support desks need detailed ticket information (more than what native Zendesk export provides)

Nice-things-out-of-box:
- without rate limiting, it is easy to hit the caps of Zendesk exports and receive an error

## How to use
- Recommended to install python and jupyter notebook so you run it locally
- Clone/ fork this. In your terminal, run ```jupyter notebook``` in the directory where you cloned this repository
- Update the code to use your zendesk domain and credentials

If using colab or equivalent of jupyter notebook online, do update and store your credentials securely
